# Final-project-Lighthouse
Capstone DATA SCIENCE Project with Enzyme Stability Prediction
## Project&Goals
  In Biology Industry, enzymes are widely-use protein in many applications. However, many enzymes are only marginally stable,  at a certain melting point (temperature level), enzymes's performance starts to drop, for this reason Biologists mutate enzymes to increase the melting point. However mutations is not alway going better, it might increase or decrease the melting point and there are hundreds of thousands enzymes with hundreds of thousands ways to mutate protein. Able to predict these mutant proteins's melting points will help saving a lots works in using these enzymes and their mutant group

## Protein propeties
  Protein sequence is a sequence of letter, every letter represent Amino acid(3 letter).
